            <p>While I did not choose to make a project based on Yosemite I have enjoyed visiting the park. I am not what I would consider a “tree hugger”, but I believe that the areas on this planet that are untouched or mostly untouched by human development are extremely precious. </p>
            <p>If you have stumbled here, I suggest you move on to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm">National Park Service Website</a>. 
            <p>The park service offers lots of information about all the park including webcams that stream amazing shots that can be enjoyed from your pc.</p>
